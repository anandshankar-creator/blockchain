# 📋 Project Status: Decentralized Voting dApp
Last Updated: 2026-02-04

## 🚀 Recent Accomplishments (Duplicate Prevention & Redeployment)
1. **Duplicate Registration Prevention**:
   - Modified `Voting.sol` to block duplicate registrations for candidates and voters.
   - Introduced `electionVersion` to track sessions. Each reset increments this version, effectively "clearing" old registration data while allowing re-registration in new sessions.
   - Added validation in `giveVote` to ensure only voters registered for the *current* election version can vote.

2. **Contract Redeployment (Sepolia)**:
   - Successfully redeployed both **Voting** and **Forwarder** contracts.
   - New Voting Address: `0x12e323fc58BEE23E5B3431469Fba3653514E166d`
   - New Forwarder Address: `0x19a81c97222FD08D1AC1008aEE4A2568c774131b`
   - ABIs and constants automatically updated in the frontend.

3. **Build & Connectivity**:
   - Verified that the MetaMask SDK remains compatible with the new contract logic.
   - Confirmed frontend connectivity with the new deployment.

## 🐛 Resolved Issues
1. **Double Registration**: Fixed the bug where the same address could be registered multiple times, causing duplicates in the UI and overwriting previous names.
2. **Session Persistence**: Fixed issue where old voters could potentially vote in a new election if they hadn't voted in the previous one (since mappings weren't cleared). Now, registration is tied to the current version.

## 🛠 Technical Notes
- **Version Tracking**: Used `mapping(address => uint256)` for `voterElectionVersion` to avoid expensive array loops or mapping clears.
- **Gas Efficiency**: The `resetElection` function remains gas-efficient as it only increments a counter and clears arrays.

## 📝 Next Steps
1. **Full Flow Test**: Register a candidate, register a voter, and cast a gasless vote to verify everything is working perfectly on the new deployment.
2. **UI Error Handling**: Ensure the "Already registered" error message displays clearly in the UI.
