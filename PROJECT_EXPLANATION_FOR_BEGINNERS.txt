PROJECT EXPLANATION FOR BEGINNERS: BLOCKCHAIN VOTING DAPP

###############################################################################

This document explains the entire Voting DApp project in very simple language.
Even if you don’t know blockchain or smart contracts, you can understand this.

===============================================================================
🔰 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
What is this project?

This is a Decentralized Voting Application (DApp).

Instead of votes being stored in one company’s database, votes are stored on a blockchain, which is:

Shared across many computers

Cannot be secretly changed

Transparent and verifiable

Think of it like a public digital ballot box that no one can tamper with.

What problem does it solve?

Traditional online voting:
❌ Admin can change votes
❌ Database can be hacked
❌ Results not transparent

This project:
✅ Votes cannot be edited or deleted
✅ No one can vote twice
✅ Anyone can verify vote counts
✅ Voters don’t need to pay gas (gasless voting)

Who uses the system?
Role	Description
Organizer	Starts election, adds candidates, approves voters
Candidate	Person standing for election
Voter	Person allowed to vote
High-Level Flow

Organizer registers candidates

Organizer registers voters

Voters vote (without paying gas)

Votes are counted automatically

Organizer resets system for next election

===============================================================================
🧩 2. SMART CONTRACTS (BACKEND LOGIC ON BLOCKCHAIN)
What is a Smart Contract?

A smart contract is like a vending machine.
You insert money → machine gives product.
No human is involved.

Similarly, this voting contract automatically:

Registers people

Records votes

Prevents cheating

📁 contracts/Forwarder.sol
Problem: Why do we need this?

Normally, when you use blockchain:
👉 You must pay a fee called gas

But voters may not have cryptocurrency.

Solution: Gasless Voting (Meta-Transactions)

Think like this:

You sign a letter ✍️
Your friend pays the stamp and posts it 📮
Post office verifies your signature and accepts it

That “friend” is the Forwarder contract.

It verifies that the vote is really from the voter, even though someone else paid the gas.

Line-by-Line Explanation

import ERC2771Forwarder
→ Imports secure gasless transaction system from OpenZeppelin

contract Forwarder is ERC2771Forwarder
→ Our contract uses that system

constructor() ERC2771Forwarder("VotingForwarder") {}
→ Names our forwarder service

That’s all. This contract just acts as a trusted courier.

Viva Questions (Forwarder)

Q: What is Forwarder.sol used for?
A: To allow gasless voting using meta-transactions.

Q: Who pays the gas?
A: A relayer (backend or script), not the voter.

Q: What is ERC2771?
A: A standard for meta-transactions.

📁 contracts/Voting.sol (MAIN CONTRACT)

This is the brain of the election.

Important Roles
Role	Power
Organizer	Adds candidates, voters, resets election
Voter	Can vote once
Candidate	Receives votes
Key Concepts

_msgSender()
Used instead of msg.sender because of gasless voting.
It finds the real voter even if a relayer sends the transaction.

electionVersion
Like election year: 1, 2, 3…
Used to reset system without deleting history.

Candidate System

Organizer adds candidates with:

Name

Age

Image

IPFS data

Address

Votes are stored in:
candidate.voteCount

Voter System

Each voter has:

Name

Image

Address

Allowed status

Voted or not

Double voting prevented by:
bool voter_voted

Voting Function

When voter votes:

Contract checks voter is registered

Checks voter hasn’t voted before

Adds 1 vote to candidate

Marks voter as voted

Reset Election (Very Important)

Blockchain data cannot be deleted.
So how do we reset?

We use versioning.

Each voter and candidate is linked to an election version.

When reset happens:

electionVersion increases

Old voters/candidates become invalid

System behaves like a fresh election

Old data still exists, but contract ignores it.

Viva Questions (Voting Contract)

Q: How do you prevent double voting?
A: Using voter_voted boolean.

Q: Can organizer change votes?
A: No function exists to modify votes.

Q: How does reset work if blockchain is immutable?
A: By increasing electionVersion, making old data inactive.

===============================================================================
🌐 3. FRONTEND (USER INTERFACE)

Built using Next.js + React

📁 context/constants.js
Stores contract address and ABI

📁 context/Voting.json
ABI → Manual that lets frontend talk to contract

📁 pages/index.js
Main page:

Connect wallet

Show candidates

Vote

📁 candidateRegistration.js
Organizer adds candidates

📁 allowVoter.js
Organizer registers voters

📁 voterList.js
Shows all voters

Viva Questions (Frontend)

Q: What connects frontend to blockchain?
A: Ethers.js

Q: What is MetaMask?
A: Wallet used to sign transactions.

===============================================================================
⚙️ 4. SCRIPTS

📁 deploy.cjs
Deploys Forwarder and Voting contracts

📁 check_candidates_sepolia.cjs
Checks candidates from command line

===============================================================================
🛠 5. CONFIG FILES

hardhat.config.cjs → Blockchain network settings
package.json → Project dependencies
next.config.mjs → Frontend settings
.env → Private keys (secret)

===============================================================================
🧠 6. BLOCKCHAIN BASICS FOR VIVA

Blockchain → Public, unchangeable record
Ethereum → Blockchain that runs smart contracts
Gas → Fee to run transactions
Wallet → Stores private keys
ABI → Contract instruction manual
IPFS → Stores images off-chain
Sepolia → Ethereum test network

===============================================================================
🔐 7. SECURITY UNDERSTANDING

No double voting

Only organizer registers voters

Votes cannot be changed

Gasless voting verified by signatures

===============================================================================
🎓 8. MASTER VIVA QUESTIONS
